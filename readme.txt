Coldfusion Random Session Russian Roulette
------------------------------------------
Introduction

This is a completely useless and evil little tool which when fired, destroys a random session completely on the server.
------------------------------------------
Why?

I was bored, felt like creating some silly little application.
------------------------------------------
Help

I'd be curious if this would work on a shared host against other users applications, as it'd be quite a security risk.
No idea if it works for Java Sessions.
